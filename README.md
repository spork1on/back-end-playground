# back-end-playground

Repository created to storage all my back-end studies content.

All content found here is created by me, following or based on my back-end journey through [DIO](dio.me), [Microsoft](learn.microsoft.com), [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) aswell as books like my favorite [C# Players Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/).

Keep on coding. 🧑🏻‍💻
